<h1>Internet Home of Michael Bishop</h1>
<p>I've thought long and hard on how <strong>I</strong> want to make websites for <strong>me</strong>. This is where I've landed. Eleventy as a static site generator and PostCSS for styling development. I am borrowing heavily from work I've previously done with Jekyll-IndieWeb.</p>
<p>This will not be a framework or a project I maintain for general use. I do encourage you to dig through the code and take any bits that might be useful. If you find a bug or have a question about a piece of code, feel free to (open an issue)[https://github.com/miklb/michaelbishop/issues].</p>
