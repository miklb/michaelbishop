[Let's Clarify some Misunderstandings around Sign In with Apple](https://aaronparecki.com/2019/06/04/23/sign-in-with-apple-misunderstandings)
Aaron is the smartest person I know on this subject so I recommend reading his clarifications if you don't understand what Sign in with Apple means.
[adactio shares the W3C Ethical Web Principles](https://adactio.com/links/15262)
* There is one web
* The web should not cause harm to society
* The web must support healthy community and debate
* The web is for all people
Amen

[Your first performance budget with Lighthouse](https://bitsofco.de/your-first-performance-budget-with-lighthouse/)
I recently discovered the Lighthouse CLI which creates a handy html report for a site. So you can navigate to your local repository for a site, run `lighthouse <url>` and it will generate the report with a timestamp so you can commit & track reports. Adding in a budget makes a lot of sense. *How* you budget is an entirely different conversation.

[Self-Host Your Static Assets](https://csswizardry.com/2019/05/self-host-your-static-assets/)
I'm a strong believer in building in performance early and often as it's the easiest way to plan for scale. But for me it's mostly been theory.

[Open gardens](http://manton.micro.blog/2019/06/02/open-gardens.html)
Manton eloquently summarizes a lot of discussion happening in certain corners of the web. Corners I prefer, that are slowly getting bigger. If you look at the above Ethical Web Principles, you will see a lot of overlap with the IndieWeb communities principles. Having your own web identity in the form of a URL that you control your content on goes a long way. Concerned people are working to make doing that as acessible as possible. It's why I work on [Jekyll IndieWeb](https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb).
