# Internet Home of Michael Bishop

I've thought long and hard on how **I** want to make websites for **me**. This is where I've landed. Eleventy as a static site generator and PostCSS for styling development. I am borrowing heavily from work I've previously done with Jekyll-IndieWeb.

This will not be a framework or a project I maintain for general use. I do encourage you to dig through the code and take any bits that might be useful. If you find a bug or have a question about a piece of code, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/miklb/michaelbishop/issues).
