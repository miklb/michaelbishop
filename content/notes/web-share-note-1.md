Inspired by @zachleat.com's evangelism of HTML Web Components I played around with turning Aaron Gustafson's <a href="https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/sharing-in-the-age-of-3p-cookie-mageddon" class="u-in-reply-to">progressively enhacing his share button</a> into a component. It's totally Aaron's code so I'm not sure about formally releasing it. But I've seen the light.
If you see Aaron, tell him I said thanks and if he's cool with it I'll clean it up and release it. [Repo link](https://github.com/miklb/web-share-button).
