Today's inner monologe was a debate over whether it would be better to use `<aside>` instead of `<article>` for *notes*â€”posts without titles. Naming things is hard, writing titles harder. (Would that be the title?) We don't write titles on social media updates/tweets/skeets/whatever, so why should we on our own sites? Which lead to questioning if articles need titles semantically. And all of that started when I was thinking about permalinks and calling articles with titles "articles" and articles without titles "notes".
