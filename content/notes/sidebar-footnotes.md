I have always wanted to use more footnotes[^1]. And I have always *coveted* folks who have managed to pull off having their footnotes hang out in the sidebar. Just feels like a better reading experience for an aside, which is how I mostly use them. Michelle Barker [demos](https://css-irl.info/another-anchor-positioning-demo-multiple-anchors/) how the coming-soon CSS Anchor Positioning will make it easier to accomplish. Unfortunately I'm not sure where Webkit/Safari is with implementing. But checking out the demo in latest Chrome, I hope it's soon.


[^1]: I use a combination of a VSCode extension and a markdown-it plugin with Eleventy.
