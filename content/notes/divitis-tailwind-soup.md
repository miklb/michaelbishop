Reading a blog post from a designer I really admire and went to take a look at their markup. Holy divitis Batman! Straight up tailwind soup. No `<main>`. No `<article>` just `<divs>` and `<p>` all the way down. It's really hard to want to care about this stuff when people who are really good at it don't seem to care.
