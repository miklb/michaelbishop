Got my first food buzz since the last time I was in New Orleans 7 years ago. Awesome that it was from the Soul Food Sunday BBQ & sides from Ella's down the street. KC BBQ doing its thing, just right smoky, creamy mac & cheese with collards spiked with plenty of vinegar but enough salt & heat to bring it all together in one bite.
