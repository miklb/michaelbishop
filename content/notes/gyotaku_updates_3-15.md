I've been holding off on posting more prints in my Etsy shop, because A–I've been busy and B–I've been busy. But also because I need to organize them and take more pics. To that end, I've ordered a circular polarizing lens for my iPhone, which should help with the glare from the cheap frames I have for stagging. I also grabbed some shipping tubes in bulk to make it easier to ship the prints. I also realized it would be a safe way to organize them so I can post multiple prints at once.

There's a species that runs late spring, striped mojarra, that I'm gearing up for. I also have some print making supplies I plan on ordering. Really looking forward to expirementing with creating my own ink. Buying the pine soot in stick form and working it into water to have better control over the moisture, particularly when working outdoors and understanding how it reacts with the different papers. Which has been its own deep dive. Very excited to see what this season brings.
