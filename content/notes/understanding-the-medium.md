I'm a nobody and my attitudes towards web development have been generally eschewed for the last decade. So it's been really refreshing to read more folks speak out about the state of the web. I've been especially nodding along to Chris Ferdinandi over on his blog, [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com/). Like this today, [Understanding the Medium](https://gomakethings.com/understanding-the-medium/).

>But the idea that the fix is to remove the need for front-end web professionals to write or understand CSS entirely is patently absurd.
