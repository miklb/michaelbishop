I don't know if this reply will work but <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Chris/111847648374546577" class="u-in-reply-to" rel="in-reply-to">@chris@mastodon.social</a>but I'm interested in this too. I have an eleventy site I built using charts.js and I stick the table into a `details` with [table-saw](https://zachleat.github.io/table-saw/) but I haven't dug deep on acessibility.
