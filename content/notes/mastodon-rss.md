Speaking of NetNewsWire and Mastodon, Brent Simmons wrote some thoughts about <a href="https://inessential.com/2023/12/17/on_mastodon_support_in_netnewswire" class="u-in-reply-to">Mastodon support in NetNewsWire</a>. I'm enjoying being able to follow Mastodon accounts using fed.brid.gy and reading them in NetNewsWire. Folks may also want to look at [Granary](https://granary.io) for converting Mastodon feeds to other formats.
