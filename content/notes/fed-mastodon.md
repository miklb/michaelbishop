Finally figured out how to follow people on Mastodon from my own site. I'm using [fed.brid.gy](https://fed.brid.gy/), which in essesnce is a bridge between the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) and the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse). You follow using fed.brid.gy and it creates a feed of your follows you can subscribe to in your reader of choice. I just add it to my feeds in NetNewsWire and I'm good to go.
