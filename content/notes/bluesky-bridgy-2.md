Another test for brid.gy & Bluesky. Hadn't authorized posting and not sure how the Netlify webmention plugin handles sending subsequent webmentions. Defintely will want to start sending my own webmentions so I can get the syndication url back from brid.gy. I hate litering social media feed with backlinks.
