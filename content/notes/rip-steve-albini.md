The news hit hard. Music has been an important part of my life since my late teens and Steve Albini's influence on the music I listen to is incalcuable. I'm not a musician and never wanted to be in a band, but over the last couple of years, the last year in particular, I wanted to be like him. Be a fucking earnest professional with a strong set of ethics and to speak up for those that can't. 

I came across this quote in one of the many [tributes](https://defector.com/everyone-has-a-steve-albini-album) written over the last day.

>"I want to do things in a certain way that I can be proud of, that is sustainable and is fair and equitable to everybody that I interact with. If I can do that, then thatâ€™s a success, and success means that I get to do it again tomorrow."
