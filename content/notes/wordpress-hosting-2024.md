I'm doing more WP work these days and while it's been fun to throw in some Jamstack I need to dogfood some WP too. Think I'm going to move to WP.com for hosting. I'm paying $7 a month for bare bones VPS. I learned from Chris Coyier [WP.com has GitHub Deployments](https://chriscoyier.net/2024/04/04/wordpress-com-has-studio-a-native-app-for-running-wordpress-locally-and-github-deployments/) and when I looked at the pricing annually, it makes sense.
