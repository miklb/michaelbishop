Took everything I've learned from
 [Lean Web Club](https://leanwebclub.com) so far and rewrote the pull-quote web component I'd (embarrassingly) cobbled together a few months ago. All kinds of style hooks & added the `right` attribute to float either side. Demo link in readme. https://github.com/miklb/pull-quote/
