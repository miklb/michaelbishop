Today marks the day for the [11ty International Symposium on Making Websites Real Good](https://conf.11ty.dev/). 

I'm going to try and live blog the event here rather than on social media or post a bunch of small notes on my site through to Mastodon and Bluesky.

I'll start by saying I think the philosophy behind 11ty is exactly how people want to build for the web. It's simplicity is sublime but you can supercharge and really do what ever you want with it. For front end, there aren't really any rules? Pick from a handful of templating languages, use what ever CSS you're heart desires. Data? Where ever you want it.

Aren't you tired of spending all of your time on caching web pages and dealing with servers? Get it out of the way up front and focus on the content and the design. Lower the technical debt.

The chat is great and if you understand who and what Mat Marquis has done for responsive images on the web, this says it all:
