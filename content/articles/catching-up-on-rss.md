My RSS consumption these days is using NetNewsWire synced through iCloud. I've always prefered reading my feeds on my laptop, probably because I've never picked up an iPad after having a 1st gen. But I also started reading RSS years before reading them anywhere but the desktop was an option.

I sort them oldest to newest and use the keyboard—I use arrow keys—to navigate through the list. I used to read everything in the app, but more recently as more folks are posting from their personal sites, I like to click over and read the longer posts in its native format. Especially web folks. It's a great way to see what everyone is doing with their sites. View a little source.

NetNewsWire has the preference to open links in the background and the keyboard shortcut `b` will open the active item in the browser. That way, I can triage my feeds without suffering from inbox overload. I'd rather suffer from browser tab overload. At least that way when I need a diversion, I have a curated set of links ready to go.

From there I read the post and if it's something I think I'd like to reference in the future, bookmark in Safari. Now that I've gotten the site back up, I might add bookmarks as a collection and start posting the meaty reference material here. Regardless I'll be sharing links to stuff that stands out to me.

As I started typing this out I decided to go ahead and put my [OPML file up on GitHub](https://github.com/miklb/opml). I'll try to keep it up to date. I'm not sure how useful it will be to anyone, but it's there. I don't delete feeds so there's a lot in there for nostalgia's sake.
