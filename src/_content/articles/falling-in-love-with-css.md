I wrote my first HTML around 1998 while working as a chef and wanting a website for our restaurant. Fast forward to 2005 and I was toying with a personal blog and taking classes in community college. Mine was still teaching Photoshop -> export as tables -> Edit in Dreamweaver -> Publish.

Meanwhile, the new WordPress theme system shipped with a new default theme that was built using CSS. So I began learning CSS so I could customize my blog. Assuming because the instructor also wrote the book we were using to “learn Dreamweaver”, CSS was out of the question. I quickly soured on community college and dropped out.

But I was soon being offered money to fix WP themes—minor template customizations, fixing floats, etc.

But somewhere along the line, in my desire to learn about the entire process and system to serve a webpage, I stopped learning CSS. I kept up with what folks were doing, and had a general idea of what browsers supported. I’d often copy/paste code to achieve a desired effect and move on. And that’s OK! But then I took a break from web building (to cook ironically) and a whole bunch of stuff happened. When I came back, I was focused on the deeper plumbing, slowly trying to catch up with the advances of CSS. I walked away from a business opportunity over a disagreement to start building with flexbox for a product that wouldn’t launch for 6 months. I knew browser support would be there and we’d make our lives easier.

Then came css-grid. It sounded awesome. I would read the tutorials, look at the examples, but it didn’t click.

Then it did.

A cascade of understanding (see what I did there?) began to flow. The interaction of flex and grid-in-grid. Custom properties. I read the [2018 report](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-2018/) and now understand modules and how it’s an improved method of releasing new features, or how if there is a consensus among browsers a feature can be adopted.

I also understand now how to use PostCSS so I can write the most modern CSS that is in current recommendations and use the build tools to backfill with polyfills for browser support based on how far back I want to go.

I did all of this by eliminating any build tools, frameworks or preprocessors first. An editor, HTML & CSS. And only when I absolutely needed to add a more complex layer, did I do so.

But most importantly, I fell in love with my own website again.
