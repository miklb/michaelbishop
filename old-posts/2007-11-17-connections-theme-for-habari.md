<p><a href="http://www.twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/2007/11/17/habari-theme-connections-01alpha-released/">Michael Harris</a> has released a port of the popular WordPress theme, Connections, for Habari.  It’s good to see another port out there, obviously themes and plugins are what new user/adopters are going to be looking for.  I’ll be updtating Mzingi and Harvest Field over the weekend, and hopefully work on another design port for this site.</p>
