<p>I have had this draft sitting around for awhile, but in the last two days I’ve seen the word “blog” used incorrectly several times, and decided to dust this off and publish it.</p>

<p>You have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blog</a>.  When writing for this web log, you are blogging, “I think I’m going to <strong>blog</strong> about the movie we saw last night”, I <em>blogged</em> about how I built the best mouse trap. You can call yourself a blogger.  <span class="pquote-r"> A blog however is not each individual entry or post you write.</span> Please do not tell me you wrote 3 blogs last night.  You can tell me you blogged 3 articles, or you wrote 3 entries for your blog, but you did not write 3 blogs. Do not tweet “my new blog” and link to an entry. When I see “new blog” I’m expecting a completely new site from the one you already have.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t claim to be a grammar nazi or even have the best grammar. But this is less about grammar and more about semantics and something that simply gets my goat.  Feel free to contradict or refute my position. I’m all ears.  Also, I came across a great blog <strong>post</strong> sometime back, <a href="http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html">on the history of weblogs</a> you may find interesting.</p>
