Ok. that was the last test. I give up on posting images via Micropub on WordPress. I'll be moved by morning. This domain will probably go dormant while I move, then still not sure if I'll continue to blog here. ðŸ¤” I'll make sure to post a new feed link for the one or two who may be following that way.
