<blockquote>West: I hate the way they portray us in the media. You see a black family, it says, "They're looting." You see a white family, it says, "They're looking for food." ...and they've given them permission to go down and shoot us!...<strong>George Bush doesn't care about black people!</strong></blockquote>
