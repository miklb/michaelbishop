So as parents are assessing report cards and schools are gearing up for tests that basically determine the school grade, guess what my partner's school's faculty meeting was about? Shooter drills.

To make sure they are not only locked in, but to make sure they aren't in line of fire if shooter is firing through the door. That's what our teachers are going home to think about today. Not how to help the kids suceed, but to make sure they know the line of sight through a door. Mind you, a whole wall of her classroom is windows, so that whole idea is completely out the window. But yeah, tell me more about how we can't ban weapons of war.
