<p>I’ve been reading more and more about the concept, and have tried using some Photoshop tools for helping with the concept when doing up a layout mock, but watching and listening to Khoi Vinh and Mark Boulton talk about it from their session at the SXSW Interactive helped immensely.  You can read more about Khoi’s presentation, as well as <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2007/0318_oh_yeeaahh.php">download the slides in .pdf format on his blog, Subtraction</a>, and download the podcast from the <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/blogs/podcasts.php/2007/05/">official SXSW site.</a><em>scroll down about 2/3 of the way for the link</em>.  Certainly a lot of good information in the comments on the blog as well, particularly links to books about the subject.</p>
