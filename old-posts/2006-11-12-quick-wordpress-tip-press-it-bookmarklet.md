<p>I’ve used the “Press It” bookmarklet about as long as I’ve used WordPress.  When the feature was originally used in 1.5.x, a new window would open up, and you could reference the original site for what you wanted to use for content.  In 2.0.x, it takes you from the site to your write post panel, which means I either have to go back and re-open the site, or remember what it was I wanted to use from the site.  That is until today.  I accidently had some text highlighted on a page when I used the bookmarklet, and when taken to the write post page, the highlighted text was pasted into post panel.  Cool!  Now I can highlight a blurb for a blockquote, then “Press It”, and simply add the blockquote html tags and finish the post.</p>
