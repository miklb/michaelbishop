<p>Poor, poor, Mike Brown.  He feels humiliated that he was pulled out of New Orleans.  How bloody humiliated are the people living in conditions in the hurricane stricken region?   How much money of ours has been squandered in the lack of preparation?  And to that end, is this another “falling on the sword” loyal lap dog?  At what point will the Bush administration, and Bush specifically be held responsible for appointing lap dogs like Brown.  How many deaths will it take?  Obviously more than 2000, as Iraq has proven.  But how about the 45 dead bodies that were found in the hospital today?  Were they preventable?  I wonder how they felt about the privatization of Social Security?</p>
