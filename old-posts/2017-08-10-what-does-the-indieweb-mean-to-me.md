Today in an important video conference I wore my IndieWeb Camp t-shirt. They couldn’t see it, but I felt like a superhero.

Not because I’m in some kind of club, but because of the principles behind the IndieWeb. Empowering yourself to own your content. Learning about the technologies behind it and sharing that knowledge with others.

Not to mention the brilliant people from all over the globe I’ve been exposed to over the past 12 years of working with people who build tools to allow anyone to have a voice on the Internet. That exposure and sharing of knowledge has made me a better person, and that makes me feel like a superhero.
