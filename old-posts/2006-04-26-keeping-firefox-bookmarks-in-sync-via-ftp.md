<p><a href="http://www.sendung.de/archives/2006/03/23/synchonizing-firefox-bookmarks-via-ftp/">sendung.de ? Blog Archive ? Keeping Firefox Bookmarks in Sync via FTP</a> had been looking for a way, and finally found it.  Works great with both my ibook and mac mini.  Will look to install on my Windows box as well.
<strong>EDIT</strong>I found this extension to be a much <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2410/">better version</a>, that works with 1.5.0.3</p>
