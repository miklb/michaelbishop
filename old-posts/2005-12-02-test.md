<p>So while doing a design for someone, I came across this site - <a href="http://www.blogbox.com/linkblox.php">Linkblox</a>.   Among some other flash type widgets, this one presents your links in a compact widget, especially if you have them categorized.  What’s nifty about this free widget, is that is uses OPML.  While not that familiar with it, a quick poke around the <a href="http://support.wordpress.org">forums</a>, I discovered that the links manager built into WordPress already outputs your links in an OPML file.  It’s found in your root WP folder at wp-links-opml.php.   The linkblox site simply asks for you to point to a OPML file, your URL, and then outputs a script  for you to place in your header and sidebar.  One for the header, one for the place you want your widget.  So what’s nice, is you can continue to use your “link this” bookmarklet, and keep your blogroll/links in your DB, so if the “linkblox” site disappears, or you decide to stop using it, you still have all your blogroll safely at your site.  The advanced customization for the widget gives you quite a bit of color customization, and the site promises this is a work in progress, which is why they are hosting the script, so that can make upgrades seamlessly behind the scenes.</p>
