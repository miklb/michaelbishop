<p><a href="http://habariproject.org/en/0-4-released">It’s official</a>, Habari 0.4 DR has been released.  It’s <em>hopefully </em>, the last developer release, and with .5 will enter beta status.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://miklb.com/habari-0-3-released">previously discussed</a> what it is about the community that gives me that <em>warm fuzzy</em> feeling, and that continues to be the case as the project grows.  It’s especially enriching to see new community members contributing.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who helped make this release possible.</p>

<p>For a little more info about the new release, I’ll let one of the newer community members, Michael Harris, <a href="http://www.twofishcreative.com/michael/blog/2008/02/22/habari">outline some of the big changes</a>.</p>

<p>I’m very excited about where this project is going, and can only imagine where it will be a year from now.</p>
