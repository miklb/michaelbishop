<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37431362@N00/3234529497"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3122/3234529497_e526467896_m.jpg" class="right" alt="screenshot" /></a>So I was looking at mobile blogging apps, assuming I couldn’t post directly from Safari on the iPhone, but alas, it seems I can!</p>

<p>Holy cow, I can even post from the Flickr silo!</p>

<p>This kinds blows my mind. Certainly not a primary mode of blogging, but to be able to take a photo with the camera, upload to Flickr, then write a blog post is kinda amazing.</p>

<p><em>Edit (not via iPhone)</em> To be clear, my amazement isn’t in the iPhone, rather, in the quality of design and code of Habari that it just <strong>works</strong>, even in the mobile Safari browser.</p>
