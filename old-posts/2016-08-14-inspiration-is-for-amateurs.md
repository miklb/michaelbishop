<p>Tina Roth Eisenberg often has great quotes on her blog, SwissMiss. Catching up on my feeds this past week, she shared a quote <a href="http://www.swiss-miss.com/2016/07/get-to-work-2.html">“Get to Work”</a> that struck a nerve as I’ve been guilty of <em>waiting for inspiration</em> all week.</p>

<blockquote>
The advice I like to give young artists, or really anybody who’ll listen to me, is not to wait around for inspiration. Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work.

If you wait around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in the brain, you are not going to do an awful lot of work. All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself.
