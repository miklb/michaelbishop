<p>If you are looking for an XHTML 1.1 valid mod of Habari’s k2, be sure to check out Harry’s <a href="http://codeb.us/redarry-theme">Redarry Theme</a>, complete with “Red-dy” goodness.  I really like the subtle gradient for the tabs in the header.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Habari community Harry, we look forward to seeing you around!</p>
