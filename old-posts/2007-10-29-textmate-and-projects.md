<p>I really, really, <em>really</em> love using TextMate, but I one feature I feel is missing, is the ability to set a project to open on launch.  More often than not, I’m using TextMate in conjunction with Transmit, and have a project set up to keep temp files from Transmit collected together, using tabs, vs 12 open windows.  I’d love for that project to be set to open on launch, vs the preference now of just being able to open a blank file.</p>
