<p>Potentially one of the worst natural disasters in the last 25 years, a breakdown in the Iraqi constitution, soaring crude oil prices, and where’s George?  Hunkering down in Mississippi?  No.  Meeting with experts on alternative energy? NO.  Bringing together representatives of the Sunni and Shiite factions to work out a compromise? Hell no.  He’s sitting with a bunch of retirees in Sun City stroking them about the advantages of privatized Social Security.  Oh, sure, you say, “he did tell the folks in Lousiana and Mississippi that the country would pray for them.  You know, on second thought, go back to Crawford George, and take the rest of the year off.</p>
