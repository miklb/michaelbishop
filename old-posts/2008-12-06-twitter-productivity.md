<p>Twitter Productivity.  Sounds like an oxymoron doesn’t it?  Well, with the recent announcement of <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/iwantsandy/topics/a_fork_in_the_road_an_important_announcement_about_i_want_sandy">i want sandy’s demise</a>, I came across a Twitter bot that actually seems like a productive tool for the Twitterer.  <a href="http://twitter.com/timer">Timer</a> allows you to simply follow it, in which it then follows you.  Then you simply send Timer a direct message to remind you of something upcoming, ie, d Timer 60 call client X.  You’ll then get a direct message 60 minutes later reminding you to call client X.  Seems it only recognizes minutes, so I’m not sure how efficient it is for reminding you of something past the short term, but it’s still an interesting tool.  Couple the concept with the fact that the developers of i want sandy are now working for Twitter, we might see similar type tools integrated into Twitter.</p>
