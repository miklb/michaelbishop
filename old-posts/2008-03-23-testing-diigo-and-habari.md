<p>I recently discovered <a href="http://diigo.com">Diigo</a>, and am testing their post to blog feature built into their toolbar with Habari.  Figured h0bbel was a good link to use :-D</p>

<blockquote>
Did you know that currently there are thirteen publicly available themes ready for download and usage for your Habari install? Some of the themes that are available are ported from other blogging platforms, others are "pure" Habari themes that doesn't originate anywhere else.
