<p>In a case of life imitating art imitating life <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/baltimore_city/bal-md.ci.indict10jan10,0,48597.story">the Baltimore mayor was indicted</a> on 12 counts of felony theft, perjury, fraud and misconduct in office.  I can see Lester Freeman and his crew heading the investigation, Bunk and McNulty laughing about the headlines as they pass a bottle of Jamesonâ€™s in an empty lot.</p>

<p>And from reading the article, it sounds like the mayor and her attorney are taking pages right out of the Clay Davis/Clarence Royce playbook.</p>

<p>Man, that was a great show, I really look forward to another project from Simon.</p>
