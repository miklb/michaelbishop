<p>I posted this to Twitter yesterday, but was quite pleased with how it turned out, and just wanted to post it up on this here blog.  I used the “magazine” option in the iPhone app <a href="http://www.nevercenter.com/camerabag/">Camera Bag</a>.  It was just before sunset, when this huge flock of crows flew into the neighborhood and lighted in a big oak tree across the street.  The neighbor was cleaning out his garage at the time, and every time he took stuff out of the garage and threw it into the garbage can, the tree would explode with cawing birds that would swirl around the trees.  I just happened to be sitting on the porch with phone in hand as it was happening and snapped a few shots.  I’m occasionally surprised by the quality of pics a mobile phone, and the iPhone in particular can take.  I still remember my first digital camera only being 1.3 megapixel and the size of a small refrigerator.</p>
