<p>I spent last evening making the necessary tweaks to this site to get a perfect 100% score on Googleâ€™s
<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Pagespeed Insights</a>. I understand this is just a personal site, but at the root,understanding how to make this site fast will translate to helping bigger projects keep an eye out for potential bottle necks.</p>

<p>Which is why when Aaron Gustafson <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronGustafson/status/724448660076027904">tweeted</a> this posts headline, it caught my eye.</p>

<blockquote>
Either way, you could do much worse than to make your bit of the web fast.
<cite><a href="https://peterchamberlin.com/fast.php">Peter Chamberlin</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>The context was more broad and I believe directed towards larger sites, but it has to start somewhere.</p>

<p>Also, I plan on sharing how I implemented the changes to get to 100%, specifically the critical CSS.</p>
