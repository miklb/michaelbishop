I have an Amazon Fire TV stick, but haven't used the Alexa on the remote much at all, but news that the Echo & Alexa now [integrates with Apple Calendar & Reminders](https://www.appleworld.today/blog/2017/5/31/amazon-alexa-now-supports-icloud-calendar-and-reminders) has me intrigued. I know there are rumors Apple may be entering the market with their own competing device, and I'll certainly hold off on pulling the trigger, but definitely shifts me into *may buy* column if Apple doesn't actually enter the fray. WIll be an interesting June.
