So my tale of getting webserver working again in Mojave stands at this: nginx is running. When I run a port scan on `localhost` port 80 diesn't show up. Now if I fire up a simple server with python `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80` I get a system prompt for permission to listen and then `http` shows up in port scan. Somehow I need to trigger than permission for nginx is my guess. Anyone experience this?
