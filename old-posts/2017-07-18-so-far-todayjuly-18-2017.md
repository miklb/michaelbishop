* Did some work on a WordPress theme
* switched javascript linters in a gulp task
* Fixed erors that appeared in said linter
* started laundry
* made snacks for trip (homemade granola bars)
* mopped kitchen
* email and Basecamp comms


Still feels like I haven't gotten nearly enough done. But it helps to see it on a list.
