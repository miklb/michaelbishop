<p>T<img src="http://miklb.com/user/images/Firefox4_app_tab.png" class="right" alt="Firefox 4 App Tab" />he App tabs in Firefox 4 was a feature I hadn’t seen until this <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2011/03/24/firefox-4-the-app-tab-an-instant-time-saver/">handy post from Freshbooks</a> passed through Reeder.  It was immediately one of those “how awesome is that moments.”  I live in Basecamp, so that was my immediate thought.  But then, oh, yeah, Pinboard, and Instapaper.  Now I’m looking for other sites I routinely visit daily to add.</p>

<p>Speaking of Firefox 4, I was literally a day away from looking at switching to Chrome as my everyday browser, but I checked out the release candidate and pleasantly surprised by the difference.  A few days later it was formally released, and I’m no longer looking to switch.</p>

<p>Have you found any hidden gem features in Firefox 4?</p>
