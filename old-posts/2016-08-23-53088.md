<p>I think the question should be less why do pull quotes exist, but why are sites lazy in their implementation. There are already solutions to only show the quote once, both with just <a href="http://miekd.com/articles/pull-quotes-with-html5-and-css/">HTML/CSS</a> and <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200609/automatic_pullquotes_with_javascript_and_css/">javascript</a>. Iâ€™m sure other solutions could be found.</p>
