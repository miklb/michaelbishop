<p>Some may know that I had a string of posts regarding Tom Delay, and though he keeps his nose out of the public eye lately, an associate of his has not had the same opportunity.  In a case unrelated to his lobbying shenanigans, Jack Abramoff is facing numerous fraud charges stemming from a partnership he was involved in that purchased the SunCruz Casinos several years back.  Coupled with that purchase, is the still unsolved gangland style murder of the man whom the partners purchased the gambling boat line from.  At what point does some draw a connection between a lobbyist buying a gambling boat line, representing gambling interests, and a man shot dead in a hail of gun fire?  To that, at what point does someone question the nature of his relationship to the Republican power, as in the likes of Delay?</p>
