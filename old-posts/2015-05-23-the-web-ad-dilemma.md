<p>I’ve been thinking about this subject quite a bit lately. While tools like Safari’s <em>Reader View</em> can help, the desire to support advertising on the web is impossible to square with the current implementation on most web sites.</p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://twitter.com/jimray">Jim Ray</a> breaks it down much more succinctly than I have been able to. <a href="http://flickerfusion.com/blocking-ad-blockers-with-better-ads.html">Blocking ad-blockers with better ads</a></p>

<blockquote>The problem may be murky, but the solution is a bit more clear, if not exactly novel: build a better product. Not a fancier iPad app, a better ad product. For all the haranguing about native ads, they have the advantage of being immune to filters and, when done right, a genuinely better experience, certainly better than green double-underlines or the “content marketing platform” ads at the bottom of far too many web pages.</blockquote>

<p>Just give me a well designed, compelling advertisement. Hell, I’ll share my browsing history if that is what it takes to serve me something I’m genuinely interested in.</p>
