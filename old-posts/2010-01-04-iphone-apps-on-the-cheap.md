<p>I’m always on the prowl for cheap (read FREE) iPhone apps, and finding a simple source for such is no easy task, at least in my searches.  Unfortunately, all the sites I’ve found that cover this type of information are so full of ads and poorly designed, it’s impossible to actually find anything useful.  I have however recently discovered at dealmac.com a <a href="http://dealmac.com/rss/541-">RSS feed specifically for discounted iPhone/iPod Touch apps.</a>. I can’t say that I’ve actually found any great deals yet through it, (I haven’t had a chance to play the recent “Let’s Golf!” game posted today), but it’s a start.  And don’t get me wrong, I have no problem paying for a quality app, and do so with perhaps too regular of frequency, but still like finding a deal when I can, especially on games, which I know I’ll only play a few times, or very rarely.</p>

<p>Do you have any sites or feeds that you’d care to share?  Tips on finding apps on sale?</p>
