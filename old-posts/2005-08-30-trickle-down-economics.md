<p><a href="http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/briefroom/BriefRm">Census Economic Briefing Rooms</a>Hmm.  Household income stagnat in real dollars, poverty up, uninsured Americans, up, homeownership down a percent, yeah, sounds about time to take a vacation.  If my fellow Americans do not put this Administration and those that have supported it on a very long vacation starting next year, I’m gonna start pricing guns and land in Montana…anyone else in?</p>
