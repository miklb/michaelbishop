Aaron Jorbin's post last week [New Bash Prompt](https://daily.jorb.in/2017/01/22/new-bash-prompt/) caught my eye in passing, so when catching up on my feeds, I took a closer look. I liked the addition of showing changes in the branch. I've been using the oh-my-zsh theme Agnoster since making the switch to zsh and iTerm2, and had no complaints, so I wasn't looking to completely change prompts and themes. After looking at [a few different variations](https://github.com/dritter/agnoster-like-themes), I settled on [agnoster-fcamblor](https://github.com/fcamblor/oh-my-zsh-agnoster-fcamblor) for now.
