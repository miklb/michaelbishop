You know which chef doesn't get the due she deserves? Josephine Araldo. These books heavily influenced my cooking, even after I ventured into tropical inspired food. Rooted in Escoffier but with an approach to the land. <img src="https://miklb.com/content/uploads/2019/03/wsi-imageoptim-IMG_0520-1024x768.jpg" alt="cover of Josephine Araldo&#039;s From a Breton Garden and Cooking with Josephine cookbooks" width="1024" height="768" class="u-photo alignnone size-large wp-image-4790" />
