My current open tabs (or how I don't really have an effective `to-read` system)

A Youtube video of one of my favorite singer/songwriters filmed at our local community radio station - [Cory Branan - The Vow + Jon Snodgrass & Ben Marwood - The Chicken Legend (Hiddentrack)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5zwW-WGKvM&feature=youtu.be)

Nola.com article on a cookie recipe that is a rift on a chicory cofee meringue by Judy Walker [Coffee and chicory cookie recipe](http://www.nola.com/food/index.ssf/2017/12/coffee_and_chicory_cookie_reci.html)

And the recipe they used as starting point [ICED COFFEE COOKIES](https://www.pjscoffee.com/menu/iced-coffee-cookies/)

I'm intrigued by the idea of this cookie as my favorite local coffee, Naviera is a Cuban style espresso with chicory.

A blog post about routines and not being a morning person [Daily Notes](https://superyesmore.com/daily-notes-c718ad9855fa44e076b6832fd15fd61d)

Best of list of food wrrting at Southern Foodways Alliance [Cornbread Nation 2017](http://www.southernfoodways.org/cornbread-nation-2017/)

Jekyll plugin for adding Algolia search to your static site [Jekyll Algolia Plugin](https://github.com/algolia/jekyll-algolia)

A David Simon post about his family, failed immigration laws [Old faces and fresh dishonor](http://davidsimon.com/2376-2/)

Not exactly sure but an animated Christmas short starring the band The Gloassary [A VERY GLOSSARY CHRISTMAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBTCb1dX4qA&feature=youtu.be)

And finally, [Advocacy Tools from ACLU FL](https://www.aclufl.org/en/resources/advocacy-tools)

In a proper IndieWeb world, these would all be marked up as `bookmark-of` but I've not come up with an easy way to dump tabs to that that markup and well, I just wanted to document my diverse interests at a given moment.
