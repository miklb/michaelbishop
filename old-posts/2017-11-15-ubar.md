I hadn't heard of [uBar](https://brawersoftware.com/products/ubar) until this [deal at Apple World Today](https://www.appleworld.today/blog/2017/11/15/dont-like-the-mac-dock-ubar-4-is-a-solid-replacement-and-on-sale-today) popped up in my feed.

I normally hide the dock but on my 11" Air, but still wind up hovering over the dock distracting what I'm doing, or just get lost with so many open apps that I need to find it via the Dock. UBar covers that purpose plus more all the while in a more compact way which is great on that machine. I downloaded the demo and was instantly sold on the 50% deal. 

I look forward to exploring the customizations and recommend checking it out if you like the idea of a more customizable and compact dock replacement. It also has an advanced option to completely hide the default dock, otherwise you can move them around to different sides of the screen. Which might be handy to have 2 different areas on a larger screen.
