<p>When you’re the son of Steve Earle and your name sake is Townes Van Zandt, you’ve got some pretty big shoes to fill.  Listening to his last two albums, especially the latest, <cite>Harlem River Blues</cite>, I think he’s stepped into them quite nicely.  He’s playing live at the Crow Bar in Ybor tonight. If you don’t have plans, you should now.</p>
