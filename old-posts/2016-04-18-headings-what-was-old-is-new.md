<p>Seems HTML WG has reversed course on a previous recommendation that allowed <code class="highlighter-rouge">sections</code> to have their own <code class="highlighter-rouge">H1</code> tag, now recommending the previous norm of cascading H tags.</p>

<blockquote>
Given that this bug has been around, and not fixed in browsers, for many
years, we are proposing to remove the suggestion, and return to the model
where elements `h1..h6` have a defined level of their own.
