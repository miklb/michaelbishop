Going to try an experiment and switch to Chrome as my primary browser for a week. I have been happily using Safari Technical Preview as my primary browser since 1Password integration started working (and stock Safari before that). 

For work stuff, I still test in stock Safari (along with Chrome,Chrome Canary, Firefox and FirefoxNightly). But day-to-day browsing, it’s been Safari. There was a rough patch with resources in Safari tabs, but that’s a distant memory at this point.

One of the big reasons for using Safari was the tabs/history sync with iOS Safari. However, that’s been buggy/spotty for a few weeks, and I’m not exactly excited about debugging. Maybe I need to get off the public beta track in iOS.

Anyway, my first experiment is going to be Chrome. As much as I’m in a browser, I’m thinking one week should be sufficient for testing. Then a week with Firefox. What I can’t decide is if I should do a week with the stock browser and a week with nightly since I am using STP as my primary browser.

Now to just remember where in macOS to bloody change the default browser…

*Edit* Yeah, I knew, System Preferences -> General (but it used to be in Safari if I recall).
