<p>A piece at <cite>A List Apart</cite> today struck a nerve with a lot of developers today, myself included (if I can really call myself a developer these days.) <a href="http://alistapart.com/blog/post/overwhelmed-by-code">Overwhelmed by Code</a> touches on the constant bombardment to developers from new technologies popping up seemingly daily.
