Good on you for not giving up. I think great leaps have been made even in the last year to make IndieWeb more accessible to people without a background in programming/web development.

Micro.Blog is a good example. Webmentions on Perch will help move the needle. As more platforms adopt them, the less hoops to jump through.

I'm excited by its future, and appreciate everyone who's putting in the effort to get it working now. I do find that once you get it working, little effort is required to maintain it. Now it just feels like magic.
