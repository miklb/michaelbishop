the pain I feel down to my bones as my aunt is taking her last breathes a thousand miles away is palpable. At times in my life, Aunt Karen was as much a mother as my own, down to sending care packages when my cousin and I were 18 and living on our own for the first time (weed and cases of mac & cheese mostly.)
