> One of the greatest food items is the patty melt. It's a burger, it's a sandwich, it's delicious.


Aaron Jorbin [celebrates the Patty Melt](https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/patty-melts/) and I couldn't agree more. I don't do beef, so usually use a gardein beefless burger but recently made them with portobella mushrooms and they were outstanding.

The key is the onions. When caramelizing onions, slow and low is key.  You're not making fajitas, so you don't want your onions charred, you want them a deep golden brown. 

Perhaps that would make a good quick food blog post. I shall try to take pics next time I'm filling the cast iron with onions.
