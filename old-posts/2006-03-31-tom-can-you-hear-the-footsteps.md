In case youâ€™ve been asleep the last 4 days, Abramhoff got 5 years 10 months for his role in the Sun Cruz line purchase.  Still to come are sentences for his multitude of other indiscretions while a lobbyist.  Though that sentence is bound to be lessened based on his cooperation with prosecutors, and run concurrent to these charges.  I really hope these prosecutors are holding out for DeLay, and not just Ney.</p>
