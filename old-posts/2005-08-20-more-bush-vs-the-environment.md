Luckily, a judge didn’t see it that way, and ruled that there was no evidence that the research from several years ago was reversed.
In a related note, a similar case was ruled on on the West Coast regarding a species of salamander, in which the administration tried to lump several species together so as to remove them from the endangered species list.<br />
One can only assimilate that the reason to remove these species is so development can infringe on the habitat of these endangered species.  I’d like to know a little more about what kind of development that would be.</p>
