Speaking of Alfred App, catching up on my RSS feeds, over at [MacDrifter](http://www.macdrifter.com/2017/02/append-clipboard-with-alfred-for-mac.html), Gabe shares a great tip on appending items to your clipboard. I've been using Alfred's clipboard manager for quite some time, but this was new to me.

Previously, I used a [Popclip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) extension to append an item to the previously clipped text. (There are a ton of useful [extensions](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions/)  if you aren't familair with PopClip).

I've tried just about every app on the market, but Alfred's pop-up window is so ingrained in my muscle memory, that I actually use the clipboard manager there. Ocassionally I need to share a link from iOS, but now that there's a universal clipboard, that's about solved.

I'd love any other Alfred clipboard tips if you have them.
