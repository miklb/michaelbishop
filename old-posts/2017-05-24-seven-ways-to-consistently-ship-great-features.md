Some great tips here from Ben, especially "over communicate", especially true for distributed teams.

> When it comes to feature development, there is no such thing as over-communicating. What problem are we solving? Who are we solving it for? Why are we solving this problem? What solutions were proposed? Which was selected? How are we implementing it? What product or design considerations did we make? Do we have to make technical tradeoffs? Are there any outstanding questions? Does it actually solve what we set out to solve? Whatâ€™s the current status? Are there any blockers? What do we need to do to ship it? Make it all explicit, memorialized, and discoverable.
