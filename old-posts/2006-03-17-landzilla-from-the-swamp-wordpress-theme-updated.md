<p>I had a client who chose the Landzilla theme, but wanted some color changes.  While in the process of doing that, I found the theme used a single index file, with no seperate header, sidebar, footer, etc.  So I’ve repackaged the theme with the new colors, a  few other changes, as well as a .psd file to insert your own 181 x121 pixel images into the four boxes in the header graphic.

<p>Any questions, just leave a comment, I’ll try to help.</p>

<p>Oh, the name, well, Florida is really just one big swamp…</p>
