<p><a href="http://www.10news.com/news/5504608/detail.html">10News.com </a>  So our tax dollars can fly Cheney and his staff all over the country on fund raising jaunts, and stump speeches, but we canâ€™t give the men and women who fall in the line of duty fighting <em>his</em> war the proper and respectful transport <strong>all the way</strong> from the battle field to their home town.  Just one more disgusting fact from this administration.</p>
