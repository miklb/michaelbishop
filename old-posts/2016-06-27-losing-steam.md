<p>I had built a pretty good habit of writing and using the blog as my primary source of commentary, but a glitch (I think, which this post is partly to debug said issue) slowed me down using micropub, the holy grail of being able to post first here and syndicate to social media. Coupled with the easy trap of using Twitter, and here I am.</p>

<p>This is my personal reminder the work I put into this site is about owning my voice and words, and to find the time to reduce the friction to do so. Also, to share that experience so that others can do the same.</p>
