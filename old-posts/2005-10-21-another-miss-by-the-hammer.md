<p>Good ol’ Tom has now moved to have his judge recuse himself from the case because, among other organizations, he’s donated to Moveon.org.  So what does he want, someone who’s donated to the RNC or one of his own PACs?  Or simply a judge that hasn’t donated to any political affliations?  To me, it’s just another desperate move by a rat backed into a corner.</p>
