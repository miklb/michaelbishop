<p>So I downloaded the bleeding edge version of Firefox, code name bon echo, to poke around a bit.  Seemed a little snappier, but could have been because 98% of the plugins were disabled.  Turn it off, open my regular firefox, and without asking me, it upgraded to 1.5.0.3.  Bullshit, I say.  I don’t want the latest version, if simply for the fact that the reason I use FireFox is the extensions.  And this version, the extensions I rely on, are now disabled.  So I might as well use Safari.  I like to wait until the extensions catch up with the release.  And I’m not at all happy with the new RSS icon in the address bar.  This really was a bad move, and I’m not sure how it happened.  A really bad taste, that’s for sure.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> So I’m guessing they realized that 1.5.0.3 was borked, because 1.5.0.4 is now out, and my extensions work now.  In the meantime, I checked out <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>, a Mac mozilla based browser, and may just well use that for everyday browsing.  I don’t like the idea of using more than one, but now that I have <a href="http://miklb.com/scuttle/">Scuttle</a> set up on my site, (I used delicious, but don’t like the idea of Yahoo controlling my bookmarks), bookmarking isn’t as big an issue with the 2 browser set up.  Camino is faster, FF offers extensions that make working on web sites invaluable.  So I may just become a 2 broswer guy.</p>
