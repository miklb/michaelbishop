My initial take is that Micro$oft acquiring GitHub is it could (*should*) be a good thing. Feels like GitHub product teams have been throwing a lot of crap against the wall to see what sticks. Hopefully this will help focus efforts. Also turn Atom Editor & the desktop app over to the community and focus on improving Code, which is already superior to both.
