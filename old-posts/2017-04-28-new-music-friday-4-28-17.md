Not wanting to get into the debate between Spotify or Apple Music, or algorithms vs human curation, I've been paying closer attention to the [My New Music Mix](https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/my-new-music-mix/idpl.pm-20e9f373919da08082c0a7f8abf266bc) that updates on Fridays. Last week I remarked [how it really gets me](https://miklb.com/1520-2/) and this week, not half way into the list I've already discovered two *new to me* artists that I feel like I should have already been familiar with. [Garland Jeffreys](http://garlandjeffreys.com) a more R&B style artist, though I want to dig deeper and hear the depth of his style. On the bluegrass spectrum [Tim O'Brien](http://timobrien.net) has been making bluegrass for a long time and from reading a little about him, his music has been at the forefront of the genre for quite some time as well. 

Not every track is monster right away, but it makes for a break from the go-to artists, and maybe, someday one of these will be on that stranded on a desert island album list. Just maybe.
