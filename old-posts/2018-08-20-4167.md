A little appropos seeing this quote shared by Matt today after I wrote this last night

"WordPress was orginally about making it easier to put words and pictures on the Internet. Gutenberg and 5.0 is about ushering in a new interface to do that. We should at least fight to make the full IndieWeb experience a little easier to be a part of that change."
