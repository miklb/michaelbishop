<p>For many reasons, I have not used the streaming music from <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a>.  That is, until today.  I first read a <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060507110841475">hint</a> on how to use iTunes and Apple Scripts, however, that solution didnâ€™t work.  Another comment on the hint pointed to <a href="http://amua.sourceforge.net/">Amua</a>, which basically streams the music via iTunes.  Excellent stuff.  I now can stream my last.fm music through my stereo, using the Airport Express.  If you are a last.fm user, by all means, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/miklb">add me as a friend</a>, or at least check out my musical tastes.  Though still a bit buggy, my <a href="http://miklb.com/lifestream">Lifestream</a> also tracks my most currently played selections.</p>
