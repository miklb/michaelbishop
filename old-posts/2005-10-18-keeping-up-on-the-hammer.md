<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/17/AR2005101701024.html">Washington Post </a>As I’ve stated in various other online existences, life away from the laptop has changed, some for the good, some not so.  Alas, the world keeps turning, and so does the clown rodeo kown as the Tomd DeLay defense.  His lawyers are know trying to squash the money laundering because “wire transfers are not ‘funds’ “… if that’s not a backhanded admission of guilt, nothing is.  “If the glove does not fit, you must acquit”.  And to further the never give in persona of ol’ Hammer, he passed on a plea offer of a misdemeanor charge of violating Texas election laws, thus the felony charges that he currently faces.  Tom, you shoulda listened closer to the <em>Gambler</em>, “you gotta know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em…”</p>
