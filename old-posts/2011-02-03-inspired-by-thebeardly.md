<p><a href="http://andrewnorcross.com">Norcross</a> linked to <a href="http://www.thebeardly.com/">The Beardly</a> today with the quip, “this is amazing. enough said”, and I agree.  I’ve been growing out a beard for about 7 weeks now, first time I’ve simply stopped shaving completely.  Most people don’t even recognize me.  That’s cool too.  Anyway, inspired by The Beardly…</p>
