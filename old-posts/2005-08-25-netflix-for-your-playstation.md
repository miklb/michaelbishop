<p>Ok, so we use Netflix, and it’s great.  Even if I don’t watch a film for 2 weeks, it’s there, and I don’t feel too guilty for only watching 3-4 films in a month, it still only costs the $18, roughly.  Anyway, just saw a commercial for <a http://www.gamefly.com”>Game Fly</a>, a Netflix clone for video games. 2 games at a time for $21.95.  Certainly would beat dropping $50 to find out a game flat out sucks, and try and dump it on ebay for $30, to try and recoup your lost.  Will let you know how it works.</p>
