<p>I’m just now catching onto Margo Price, but if you are a fan of classic country without the commercialization, then she is right up your alley. Calling her <em>classic country</em> probably isn’t a fair characterization, but I’ve never been good with music genres anyway. However you slice it, she’s a brilliant song writer with a sound that is both familiar and fresh at the same time.</p>

<p>This selection from the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/11/22/503055186/margo-price-tiny-desk-concert?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=music">NPR Tinydesk series</a> is a perfect primer. I look forward to her making a trip to the Tampa area in 2017.</p>
