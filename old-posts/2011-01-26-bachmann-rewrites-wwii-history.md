<p>I clicked over to CNN this evening to catch the Bachmann response to the President’s State of the Union speech.  It’s the car crash scenario - no matter how ugly it is, you can’t look away.  What got me though was this line, “yet this picture immortalizes the victory of young GIs over the incursion against the Japanese,” as she had the iconic image of the Marine’s raising the US flag.</p>

<p>Wait, did I hear that right? The “incursion <strong><em>against</em></strong> the Japanese”? I rewound the DVR 3 times to make sure I didn’t hear her wrong. Nope, she went on to say, “to symbolize all of America coming together to beat back a totalitarian aggressor.” What totalitarian aggressor does she think they fought back?  Hitler?</p>

<p>Listening to the pundits afterward, the only thing they talked about was the oddness of a second, “unofficial” Republican response. Or the fact that the camera that CNN used wasn’t the one that Bachmann was looking into.  DID YOU NOT HEAR HER REWRITE WORLD WAR II HISTORY?</p>

<p>So I thought, maybe I didn’t hear her say that, and sought out to check. Nope, sure enough, CNN has a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/01/25/sotu.response.bachmann/">transcript of the Bachmann response</a>, and it’s right there.</p>

<p>Check the video yourself, (do yourself a favor and fast forward to the 5:45 mark).</p>

<p>While looking for this, I also read that earlier today she also rewrote some other American history by saying the founding fathers fought to end slavery.   You know, by getting them counted as 3/5 a person and all.</p>

<p>I’d be very curious to hear what a Tea Party veteran, particularly a WWII vet has to say about their official spokesperson saying they helped save the Japanese.</p>
