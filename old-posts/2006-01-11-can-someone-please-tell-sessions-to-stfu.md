<p>Watching the Alito Confirmation Hearing on CSPAN, and now the second time I’ve listened to Jeff Sessions of Alabama blubber over Alito.  Who voted him head cheerleader?  Is he not intelligent enough to fake the tough questions, or too stupid to lob the easy ones for Alito to hit out of the park?  I mean, I’m not impressed with the some of the lines of questioning I’ve seen from the Democrats either, but this bafoon takes the bloody cake.  If these 16 some odd folks are the best this country can muster, we are worse shape than I thought…</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> OK, now Graham is trying to compare Alito’s confirmation hearing to crooked Republicans who have taken money from Abramhoff.  WTF??</p>
