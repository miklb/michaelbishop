I feel like more people coming into open source projects need to understand how & why something is being done a way before just barging in the door and exclaiming "Hold everything! This all has to be changed. You're doing it wrong!â„¢"

A chef taught me early on in my career that's it is important to know the reasons things are done a certain way before suggesting change. Often times, there's a technical limitation preventing teams from doing things they know could be done better. Respect that experience.
