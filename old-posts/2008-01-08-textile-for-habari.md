<p>I’m quite happy to see a new Habari user, Dylan, over at Trifold Design, has created a <a href="http://blog.trifolddesigns.com/textile-2-0-0-plugin-for-habari">Textile plugin for Habari</a>.  I too use many of the same tools Dylan does, and find myself using that markup more and more, even in email and on IRC (though, embarrassingly I didn’t realize it was actually Textile).</p>

<p>I haven’t actually tested the plugin yet, though it did install fine, and it’s a .5 release, so I assume the author has vetted it himself.</p>

<p>Also, welcome to the community Dylan, it’s always great to see new people join in.</p>

<p>For those that are looking for other markup plugins, you might look at Matt Read’s <a href="http://drunkenmonkey.org/projects/habari-markdown"> Markdown</a> plugin as well.</p>
