<p>This band just rocks me. I can not wait for the whole record. God knows what bands they listen to.</p>

<p>Steve Albini, do your homework.</p>

<p>Pixies? Sure.</p>

<p>Nirvana? Had to.</p>

<p>Bands I missed out when I was doing stuff? I want to know them too.</p>

<p>Please, more music like this.</p>

<p>That bass line. Be still the 23 year old still in my heart.</p>
