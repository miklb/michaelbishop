<p>I had an interest to learn the programming language python for quite some time. I’ve played around with it a little using <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/pythonista/id528579881?at=10lKmy">Pythonista</a> in iOS to <a href="https://miklb.com/use-pythonista-to-get-weather-of-current-location-into-drafts-app">build a fishing log</a>, but otherwise have only done some cursory reading. Since I do best learning by doing, I needed an idea to <strong>use</strong> python. I’ve seen some interesting Twitterbots built with it, <a href="https://twitter.com/pomological">@pomological</a> being my recent favorite, but wasn’t sure what to build. Ultimately, the idea came to me to build a bot that retrieves an image from Flickr and builds a color scheme from that and post the scheme and original image. I’ve done some basic research and found some libraries to connect (you didn’t think I was going to write the whole thing from scratch?).</p>

<p>But I don’t just want a any random image, so once I get the bot <em>working</em>, I want to be able to try and pull outdoor/landscape images. In a perfect world, I would post 3 images a day—morning, noon, and night. The morning image would be a sunrise, noon/daytime image a normal image and, you guessed it, the night/evening image would be a sunset.</p>

<p>I figured I needed a name for the Twitterbot, not only to make sure something would be available, but since I would need API keys, that has been my first tangible step to create the bot. Thus, @Flickolorbot has been officially conceived.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more adventures.</p>
