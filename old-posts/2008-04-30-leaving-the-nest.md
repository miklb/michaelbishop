<p>This past week it was proposed and not shot down in flames that my first foray into a Habari theme, <a href="http://miklb.com/mzingi">mzingi</a> , intended as a simple, image free theme to be used as a foundation for building proper themes, should be included into the core download of <a href="http://habariproject.org">Habari</a>.</p>

<p>I was humbled and honored to say the least, and so from here on out, all development for this project will be maintained by the community.</p>

<p>Thanks to all who’ve helped, and shared their appreciation for it’s intended purpose, and I trust the community will continue to use it for creating full fledged themes.  Feels a little odd, but satisfying at the same time.</p>
