<p>What in the world is this really?  Is CNN trying to steal Al Gore’s cable network ideas?  All the monitors, Wolf wandering around like he’s at mission control.  It’s not real, is it?  And now they’ve moved the blogger babes out from the little desk with the laptops and 23in monitors, to their own set with GIANT monitors, and now they’re standing too.  I kinda liked the fact that they seemed they were in a back room surfing on their laptops.  Now, it’s just so, blah.</p>
