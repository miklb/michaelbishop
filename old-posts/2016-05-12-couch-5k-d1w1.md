<p>I have been telling myself all year that I was going to start this, but my body was telling me something else. Today that changed. It was just day 1, walking for 12 minutes, jogging for 8, but it feels perfect and I canâ€™t wait for day 2.</p>

<p>Stats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distance 1.6 miles</li>
  <li>Pace 12:29 min/mi</li>
</ul>
