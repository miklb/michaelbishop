<p><strong>EDIT-<a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=57059">Link</a></strong>
Scanlon also admitted… he, Lobbyist A, and others engaged in a pattern of bribery through which one or both of them offered and provided a stream of things of value to public officials, including trips, campaign contributions, meals and entertainment in exchange for agreements that public officials would use their official positions and influence to benefit the clients of Scanlon and Lobbyist A as well as Lobbyist A’s businesses.</p>

<p>So Michael Scanlon, former DeLay aide, has pleaded guilty in a deal to agree to testify against Abramhoff.  Does this mean he has some dirt on DeLay as well?  Only time will tell.  I’m sure the Justice dept is licking its lips at this one!</p>
