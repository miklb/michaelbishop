Bush’s response has been so far to not comment, and send his entire staff, including Rove, to ethics class.  A whole hour long on how to handle classified documents.  That’s the best he’s got?  Not quite the “heads will roll if anyone in my administration was involved” attitude his little John Wayne act tried.  I’m sure though the Republican’s will applaud such a move.
