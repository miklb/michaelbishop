Week has been a struggle, but for this old broken line cook the joy I felt finally making brownies from scratch in my very own KitchenAid mixer & baking them in my 60 year old oven I resurrected salvaged the week. Thanks @bravetart for the perfect recipe https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/02/bravetart-glossy-fudge-brownies.html
