<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/22/AR2006022202251.html">Washington Post</a> Can someone tell me why the Chief of Staff was “so preoccupied with national security issues”?  They make it sound like he was personally out hunting Bin Laden himself.  Maybe he was, and he and Cheney took shooting lessons together, as neither hit their intended target.  I have a feeling nothing will ever come of any of this, and that the Republicans are going to successfully sweep ALL of this under the rug, until , oh 10 years from now, when someone’s broke and needs a tell all book.</p>
