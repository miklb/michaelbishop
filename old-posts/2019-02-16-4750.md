Speaking of hot sauce ðŸ‘€ saw little feature on Leah Chase on NBC News. Made point to ask her about chastising Obama for putting hot sauce on her gumbo. Snapped this painted in the median outside Dooky Chase <img src="https://miklb.com/content/uploads/2018/01/IMG_4341-768x1024.jpg" alt="folk art painting of Leah Chase with her quote - To be a woman you have to look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man and work like a dog.
