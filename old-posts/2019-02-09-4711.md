Digital plumber reference && a well written piece on the imporance of the craft of building a website
<blockquote>
Plumbers might get excited about PEX piping, but they also understand that their job is to ensure the water gets from the main to the faucet as expeditiously as before.

Water and data flow through pipes of their own, but whether data flows easily from server to client depends.
