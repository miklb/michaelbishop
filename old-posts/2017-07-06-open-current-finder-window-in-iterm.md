This evening I found myself deep in some nested folders and wanting to access it from the terminal. Now, iTerm has great autocomplete for quickly navigating somewhere, but this deep was beyond a few tab-completes. Off to Google and a few minutes later found a way to create an Automator app you can drag to the Finder tool bar. First, [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/7683131911c0cfd18d5cf8e818adffbc) walks through the steps to create the app. However, the Applescript is outdated. In the comments, there's a link to this blog post with [updated script for iTerm 2 v3](http://hohonuuli.blogspot.de/2016/02/iterm2-version-3-open-iterm-here-script.html). Finally, I picked a [custom iTerm icon](https://dribbble.com/shots/1343859-iTerm2-Icon) to complete the process.

Handy!
