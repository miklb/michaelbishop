Updated my server to debian stretch and a fresh install of nginx mainline. Site seems to be much snappier, not that it was slow before. I'll take these Lighthouse numbers on a WordPress site any day.<img src="https://miklb.com/content/uploads/2018/06/wsi-imageoptim-lighthouse_miklb.jpg" alt="overall performance rating of 92 in Lighthouse" width="338" height="264" class="u-photo alignnone size-full wp-image-4020" />
