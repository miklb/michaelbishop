<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/25/AR2005112501423.html">Lawmakers Under Scrutiny in Probe of Lobbyist</a>  I first <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blog/2005/rants/the-dung/">wrote</a> about the Firm of ASG and DeLay’s wife back in April.  Here it is almost December and it’s finally becoming a legitimate news.  Some of my favorites, DeLay’s wife was paid over 3 grand a month to determine each Congress man’s favorite charity.  One would assume that could be done by a few low level staffers in a week via  email and voice calls.  And it looks more and more like DeLay is going to be smack dab in the middle of this one too.  While we’re at it, might someone look a little further into the Brian Darling connection as well.  With Bill Nelson facing a tough election next year, this could be something to take another swipe out of the Republican machine.</p>
