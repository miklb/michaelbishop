I started with pen and paper, then moved to text editors‚Äîfirst Word, then Google Docs, and finally, plaintext files. I‚Äôve been creating plaintext outlines for about 5 years. I typically save my outlines as Markdown and export them using Pandoc if they need to be shared with other folks. I use outlines to take notes, plan projects, create documentation, and as todo lists. I‚Äôm a plaintext junky. Whenever and wherever I can, I use plaintext. I edit plaintext with either Neovim, VimR, or nvALT depending on whether I‚Äôm in the command line or not. The major hiccup in my plaintext-outline-life is when it comes to editing and creating plaintext outlines on the go. Typically, I use Coda on iOS‚Ä¶which is very much like bringing a siege weapon and a concrete mixer to a Pok√©mon card tournament. Coda is a spectacular piece of software, but very much not meant for maintaining plaintext outlines, notes and todos. I need a new tool. I want to supercharge my outlining workflow. I‚Äôm on the hunt! I‚Äôm looking for more than an iOS plaintext editor, I‚Äôm looking for a full(ish) featured outliner.   What I‚Äôm looking forCross platform, both macOS and iOS (or web-based) Document syncing (Dropbox or SFTP preferable) Ability to reorder items in a list Preferably scriptable (e.g. I‚Äôd like to be able to setup reminders triggered off of certain markup so that I can use outlines as task lists‚Ä¶but this may be asking a lot)   ContendersOmniOutlinerPlatformiOS macOS   ProsSeems to be the tried and true tool for this kind of thing OmniGroup seems to be leaning into the whole scriptability thing lately   ConsA wee bit expensive since I‚Äôd need to buy both the desktop and basic iOS clients Not 100% certain how interoperable their file formate is     WorkflowyPlatformWeb ‚ÄúDesktop,‚Äù e.g. electron app iOS   ProsI already have an account 250 free notes a month   ConsWeird to say, but it is just really ugly, aesthetically     TaskPaperPlatformmacOS   ProsPlaintext üòÅ I love how minimal this app is. It brings almost all of the functionality I‚Äôm looking for to what is ostensibly just plaintext!   ConsPlaintext üòê The biggest downside I‚Äôm seeing here is that there is no native first-party iOS client. Because the taskpaper file format is simply a set of rules around how to mark up a plaintext file, though, I could use something like Drafts or iA Writer for my mobile needs       Other Thoughts@jthingelstad recommend that I also check out mind mapping applications. I‚Äôve been doing a big of research there, too, but don‚Äôt think they fill the role with what I‚Äôm looking to do, mostly because they don‚Äôt mesh wicked well with my way of thinking. I like to think things together, nested parentheticals In writing this post, I‚Äôve come to wonder if the real solution would be to separate concerns a bit? Find an app other than Coda for editing and creating plaintext on iOS (Drafts, perhaps?) Start to use a more feature-rich todo manager other than SwiftoDo   At this moment I‚Äôm leaning towards OmniOutliner or Taskpaper‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm incredibly indecisive when it comes to this sort of thing, so who knows.

I'd take a look at Editorial for an iOS app that supports TaskPaper tasks as well as text editor. I have also used Taskmator for iOS. I'm looking at a new workflow now that will use TaskPaper again.
