<p>My work life has prevented me from doing anything much related to online life, or writing much in general. That however doesn’t mean that during the hundreds of miles a day I’ve been driving that I don’t think about it. While catching up on my RSS feeds, this post from the Pastry Box, <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/federico-brigante/2014-july-25">You don’t have time for perfection</a> sums up a lot of why I didn’t use it more when I actually did web development.</p>
<blockquote>I’ve had enough of maybe-later, of I’m too busy right now, of after I’m done with this. I’ll be publishing anything I think others will benefit from. Ten non-perfect pieces are better than zero wannabe-perfect ones.</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps from where  I’m sitting, it won’t always be what I think others might benefit from, rather a benefit to me. Be it saving a snippet of code for posterity (which <em>could</em> benefit others), reflecting on a moment or just sharing thoughts about a band. Anything to have it centralized and outside the walls of Facebook, Twitter and the like.</p>
