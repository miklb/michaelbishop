Just bought [Interact Scratchpad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/interact-scratchpad-convert-text-to-contacts/id1199660222?mt=12) a macOS companion to iOS app Interact from @agiletortoise. I can only hope this is kind of companion app leads to a @draftsapp companion. I would love to have a little menubar app that synced to Drafts on my phone and vice versa
