<p><a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/">Blog Maverick</a>
Mark Cuban, blogger and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is blogging the NBA finals.  I have to say, his blogging has made it infectious to be a Mav’s fan for the finals.  I’m not really a basketball fan, but have a few friends who’ve been watching the playoffs, so I’ve followed along.  I also came across Mark Cuban’s blog while checking out some feeds while investigating over at <a href="http://share.opml.org">Share Your OPML</a> as the playoffs started.  So I’ve been following his blogs while keeping an eye to the playoffs.  It’s fun to see things transpire as they have.</p>
