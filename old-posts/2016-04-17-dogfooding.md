<p>Last night I switched over the <em>theme</em> for this site to a project I’ve been working on the last moth or so, <a href="https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb">Jekyll-IndieWeb</a>. While I have different design ideas, until I find other users interested in using it, I knew I needed to work out any kinks. I also wanted to have better microformat support until the design changes. Thus
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a>.</p>

<p>I will write more about the project once I have more documentation (and work out any more said kinks), but the gist is I wanted to provide someone new to Jekyll with a desire to be part of the
<a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/">IndieWeb</a> a solid starting point. I rely heavily on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file for options a user can set - profile pic, social media links, choice to include display of webmentions - to quickly get a personal site up and running. The biggest hurdle for me was providing a minimal design that was unopinionated yet still aesthetically appealing. Anyone familiar with HTML & CSS can easily build upon or modify it, but if not, it shouldn’t look <em>ugly</em>.</p>

<p>This has been the first solo project I’ve embarked on that was meant for public consumption from the start, which in itself has been a learning process. Now I just hope others can find it useful in some way. If the project interests you I encourage you to try it out, open any issues in the repo, or reach out on #indiewebcamp IRC, I tend to hang around there most days.</p>
