I find myself more now than ever wanting to visualize a workflow before beginning to build it. Often that means a basic flow chart. But a simple digital tool that worked on Mac seemed elusive.

Until I began poking at Mindode more. I mentioned I started [exploring it last month](https://miklb.com/blog/2018/12/15/4579/) and it's been a pleasure. Last night, poking around more, I realized you can add addtional "main nodes" and then connect them. You can also edit the line size of connector. The trick was ⌘ clicking each node, then ⌃ clicking for the dialog box to connect the nodes. The order you click the nodes determines the direction of the connection.<img src="https://miklb.com/content/uploads/2019/01/wsi-imageoptim-mindnode_connect_main_nodes.jpg" alt="screenshot showing how to connect two nodes in Mindnode" width="780" height="312" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4676" />

I've only scratched the surface but this all but solves my search and solidiies the app as an essential tool. Mindnode is available as part of a [Setapp subscription](https://go.setapp.com/invite/3412192a-a949-49be-8153-285dafe57a70).
