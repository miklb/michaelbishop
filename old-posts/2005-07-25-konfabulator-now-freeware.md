So, after Apple sees the popularity of the widget,  they incorporate the idea into Tiger, without as much as a kiss before they screwed the developers of Konfabulator (or that’s how I read it, when the widgets were first previewed), and thus taking the feet right out beneath the developer.  Thus, Konfabulator is released as freeware. With Versiontracker filled with widget after widget, and me still plugging away with Panther, I just might stick a few up on the desktop to “pretend” to be hangin’ with Jones.
<strong>Edit*</strong>Ah, Yahoo bought Konfabulator, and had every intention to make it free.  So alls well, that ends well.  And I did grab a couple of widgets for fun…</p>
