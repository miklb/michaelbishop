I find it infinitely sad there's a story about an active shooter with an AR-15 in a hospital in the Bronx and it's not even registering on Twitter. Listening to MSNBC whle former NYC Police Commsioner describing the scene (I found it interesting he laments the "lax gun laws elsewhere"), an ex employee, rare for NYC to have a gunman w/ that kind of weapon. How have we gotten to this point?
