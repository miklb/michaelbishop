<p><a href="http://www.asmallorange.com"><img class="right" src="http://www.miklb.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/aso.png" alt="ASO" /></a>Alas, I’ve moved servers again, and it’s not been fun.  Not only am I moving this site and the subdomains, I’m moving two other domains to the new server.  I’ve ventured into the realm of managing multiple domains.  Yay! (not).  Anyway, it’s a headache but at least once it’s done, it’s done.  A Small Orange looks like great hosting so I shouldn’t have to worry about this again for a LONG time.</p>
