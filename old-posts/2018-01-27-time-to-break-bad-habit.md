This morning this tweet, part of a thread, struck a nerve with me

https://twitter.com/Roxyorz/status/956936760944218112

I am guilty of this often when it comes to writing code. I spend a lot of time thinking through **how** the functionality will work mixed with research (read: Googling similar functions). To the point I don't start writing code because I haven't completely figured it out, rather than write the part that I have, and work from there.

I've been slowly working towards a new theme for this site as I move towards my goal of a [public profile](https://miklb.com/blog/2017/11/24/towards-an-indieweb-way-of-life-public-profile/). Rather than coding out the scaffold and starting to fill in the pieces I know how I want to look and act, I've been waiting until I have a clear picture of the finish site.

That's not practical for my own site, and definitely not practical for client work.

Time to break a bad habit.
