*Note: I posted this in the Setapp Slack channel, but feel it needs to be said publicly.*

It must be frustrating to see the people posting in FB wanting to squeeze more out of Setapp for less. For me, it’s a steal @ $10 a month. I have no expectations of Omnigroup apps or other widely used expensive apps, or a subset of apps for less. I do appreciate seeing new niche apps and small developers added, but c’mon people, respect the work these developers put into their work. </rant>


If you are a Mac user and haven't looked at Setapp yet, I highly suggest you do. Lots of great apps and utilities for a mere $10 a month. And if you use my [link](https://go.setapp.com/invite/3412192a-a949-49be-8153-285dafe57a70) I get a free month.
