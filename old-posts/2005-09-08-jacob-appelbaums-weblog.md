<p><a href="http://jacob.wordpress.com/">Jacob Appelbaum?s weblog</a>
Jacob’s blogging from Houston, where he and some other SF Bay area volunteers are trying to team up with volunteers from Austin and surrounding areas to set up a Low Powered FM radio.  They have a license from the FCC, all the equipment, including a standing offer of 10,000 radios for the residents…the purpose, to easily disseminate information to the 10,000+ displaced New Orleans residents, now living in the Astrodome.  Seems perhaps <em>someone</em> doesn’t want some “free speech” to trickle down to those that need it.<br />
And I haven’t heard one cable network touch on this, though it seems the LA Times have half the story.  Stay tuned.</p>
