<p><a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/11/prism-prototype-now-available-on-mac-and-linux/">Prism</a> for mac is out.  Those not familiar, it’s Mozilla’s Webrunner app, which basically gives you a stripped down browser to run web apps in, so that you don’t have to keep multiple tabs/windows open in your browser, perfect for things like gmail, Basecamp, insert your favorite web app here.</p>
