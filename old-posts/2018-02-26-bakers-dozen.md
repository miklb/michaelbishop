Thirteen years ago today I purchased this domain. According to [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20050319093337/http://www.miklb.com:80/blog/) I referred to March 15th as my official “Hello World.”

Which was about a week and a half after [WordPress 1.5 was officially released](https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/). It wasn't a coincidence. I'd been toying with starting a blog for a couple of months, looking at all of the "free" options and being unsatisfied. Digging deeper, I found WordPress. This was still 1.2 with no real theme or plugin system - [`my-hacks.php` y'all](https://wordpress.org/news/2003/12/new-feature-my-hacksphp/). Anyway, I started playing with the beta and figuring out how to get it installed on a shared server with "pretty permalinks". Soon after the stable release I settled on a url and jumped in.

About the name—I get this question often. Back in the days of arcade and console games when you got a high score or save position, often the user name was 3 characters. My initials never clicked for me so I used `MIK`. In high school, I was *Michael B*. Somewhere between the 2 I came up with the user name `miklb` and it was a short domain and truthfully, I didn't know what I was doing. Also, all variations of Michael & Bishop were taken, dominated by a star college quarterback in Kansas.

Armed with [Smultron](https://github.com/flomac/Smultron), [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) and a desire to make my own website and blog, here I am, writing this post in Atom Editor(very much the Smultron of today), which will make it's way to a blog post on a site running a very much different version of WordPress than where it started. 

Thank you to every single one of you who've provided help, insight and friendship along this journey.
