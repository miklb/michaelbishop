As I get older, the Jan 1 demarcation of a trip around the sun has even less meaning. New Years resolutions have never been my thing, I've always thought that what ever day the calendar says is the right day to start a good habit.

Good habit building has been my focus the last three years—not coincidental to the big change in my life of going on medication for anxiety and subsequently ceasing to consume alcohol. Profesional habits as well, such as understanding documentation of code and informative git commit messages has made me a better developer.

It so happens to coincide to a flip of the calendar that I find my newest goal to be better at **focus.** 

I'm my case, focus mean applying the positive habits I've built and will continue to cultivate in the areas of responsibility in my life, both voluntary and inherent. A lot of that is going to be time management, which I've developed habits to track time, now to start analyzing data and finding trends.

I'd also like to learn to be a better writer, something that's been at the back of my mind for a long time. From what I read, to be a better writer, you have to write. But being a developer, I get so caught up on the mechanics of putting words on the internet that I don't often enough hit the publish button.
