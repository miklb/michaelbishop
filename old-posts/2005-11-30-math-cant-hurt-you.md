<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/29/AR2005112901288.html?nav=rss_politics">Zeroing Out the Messenger</a> So amongst all the Iraq/memo gate/plamegate/Katrina debates, another slug of a Republican Congress man, bought by Utilities companies in Oregon, managed to have a little known, yet important center shut down.  I <a href="http://www.miklb.com/blog/2005/rants/judge-says-bush-salmon-plan-ignores-impact-of-dams/">wrote about this</a> last May, when a judge ruled the Bush plan on the spring and fall runs of Chinook  salmon was wrong, and forced new numbers to be used.  Well, that little known agency shut down by Congressman Larry Craig was responsible for using scientific means of measuring the population of the salmon.  Long story short, Craig convinced his fellow congressman to shut down funding for the agency, and it looks like my faith in the people of the Pacific Northwest was unfounded.</p>
